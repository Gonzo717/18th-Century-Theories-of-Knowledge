# The Initial Question
I was inspired by Immanuel Kant, a German philoospher who lived from 1724 to 1804, famous for his works on subjects such
as epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics.

My interest spiked after reading Kant's _Prolegomena_, specifically on his arguments concerning the differences between analytical and synthetical knowledge, and how from that it follows that math cannot be considered fully _a priori_ kind of knowledge, made me recall similar arguments about knowledge.

For example, going back to ancient philosophy, I recall Socrates’ argument in _Meno’s Paradox_ and how he uses Meno’s slave to show that we are born with all the knowledge wen will ever need. All that is required of one is to inquire within. For example, in this example Meno’s slave is able to display geometric properties about squares through socratic questioning despite never given lessons in geometry before. Meno’s paradox showed that one cannot inquire into what we don’t know, and we also cannot know what it is that we don’t know since we do not know it, hence making it impossible to learn anything and why Socrates believed we get all knowledge from our soul

Some questions that this made me curious about was the connection between Kant’s thoughts on knowledge and learning:

### _Was he influenced by the ideas of ancient philosophers? Were there any other philosophers during his time that held a similar view of mathematics as he did? Or were his ideas more novel? If not, is there someone who inquired about this before Kant made such arguments famous to the overall public? And perhaps deeper, and harder questions to answer, such as wondering whether Kant, like Socrates, would agree that any type of learning is impossible?_
